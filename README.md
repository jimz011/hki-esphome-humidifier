# HKI ESPHome Humidifier
This component is created to be used when you have a Midea/Comfee dehumidifier and you have swapped it's wifi unit with an ESPHome variant. Specifically this component: https://github.com/Chreece/ESPHome-Dehumidifier.

ESPHome doesn't have humidifier support, so for the time being I have made this component. The above ESPHome component will expose your dehumidifier as a climate entity. This component will convert it so it is exposed in the humidifier domain. A separate fan speed entity will also be created as the humidifier domain does not support that.
